# Low Cost AI Accelerator Based on Systolic Array 

## What is the *Systolic Array*  :





## What is the *Most Significant Runs* (MSR) :

## MSR-4 Analysis : 
All four trained models exhibit MSR-4 distributions covering at least 99% of the weights. In the worst case, only about 2.9 out of every 256 weights are Non-MSR-4.

As a result, in a 256Ã—256 Systolic Array, each column would require 3 PEs capable of performing compensation.

During model training, certain methods used to prevent overfitting can also help increase the MSR-4 percentage.   
Examples include lowering the learning rate, applying L1 regularization, and L2 regularization (weight decay).  


## Quantization Accuracy Analysis (Post-train Quantization) :

For complex models like ResNet and AlexNet,   
quantization without expectation compensation leads to an accuracy drop below 20%, while with compensation, the accuracy only decreases by less than 1%.
